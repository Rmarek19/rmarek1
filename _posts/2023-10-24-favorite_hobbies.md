excerpt:  "Going to the gym"
---

or the majority of my life, I have always found ways to stay active. Starting in middle school and all throughout my sophomore year of high school, I ran Cross Country and Track. During my junior and senior years, I stayed active by doing Gymnastics, specializing in parallel bars.  After high school, I continued to run in my free time and participate in the annual Thanksgiving  day 5k race called, "The Grove Express." I also have been going to the gym to lift weights and stay in shape for a while now. Since 2021 I have been lifting consistently with my friends. I enjoy working out because it makes me feel so much better during the day and helps provide me with mental clarity. It has also taught me discipline, making sure to go consistently regardless of how I feel.
